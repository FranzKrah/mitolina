```

## Introduction

First, the library is loaded:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mitolina)
```

For reproducibility, the seed for the (pseudo) random number generator is set:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

In this vignette, I will use functionality from the `tidyverse` (the pipe operator from the `magrittr` package and `dplyr` functionality). 
More information about these are available at <https://www.tidyverse.org/>, <https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/> and <http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/>.

### Simulating genealogies

### Adding mitogenomes

#### mtDNA information included

There are several datasets with information about the mitogenome included.
There is a help file to each of the datasets which can be found by e.g. `?mtdna_partitions` for 
the `mtdna_partitions` dataset.

First, there is information about the positions from PhyloTree <http://www.phylotree.org/resources/rCRS_annotated.htm> about the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [@rCRS]:

```{r}
data(mtdna_partitions)
mtdna_partitions %>% print(n = 2)
```

There is also mutation information from [@Soares2009]:

```{r}
data(mtdna_mut_SoaresK8)
mtdna_mut_SoaresK8
```

From [@Rieux2014]

```{r}
data(mtdna_mut_RieuxK4)
mtdna_mut_RieuxK4

data(mtdna_mut_RieuxK1)
mtdna_mut_RieuxK1
```

And from [@Oversti2017]:

```{r}
data(mtdna_mut_OverstiK4)
mtdna_mut_OverstiK4
```

All these are assembled info one dataframe:

```{r}
data(mtdna_mut_schemes)
mtdna_mut_schemes %>% print(n = 2)
mtdna_mut_schemes %>% count(MutationScheme)
```

This makes it easier to use the mutation rates from for example `mtdna_mut_RieuxK4`:

```{r}
d_mu <- mtdna_mut_schemes %>% 
  filter(MutationScheme == "Rieux 2014 (K = 4)", MutRateYearly > 0)
mu_mean_year <- d_mu %>% pull(MutRateYearly)
mu_mean_gen <- 25*mu_mean_year
```

Now, `mu_mean_gen` contains a mutation rate per generation (of 25 years) for each of the `r length(mu_mean_gen)` sites. The probability of one ore more mutations in a single meiosis is then

```{r}
1 - prod(1 - mu_mean_gen)
```


Note, that to include variability in the mutation rates, 
it is probably best to sample a rate per region (in `mtdna_mut_RieuxK4`), and then distribute 
that to all sites in the partition.
